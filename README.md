# AI Basketball Analysis
 
## The Basketball Analysis System is a comprehensive project that leverages machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning techniques to analyze football matches. The system detects players, referees, and footballs using YOLOv8, tracks their movements across frames, and assigns players to teams based on the colors of their t-shirts using KMeans clustering. Additionally, it implements optical flow to measure camera movement between frames, perspective transformation to represent the scene's depth and perspective, and calculates player speed and distance covered.
