# AI Basketball Analysis
 
## The AI Basketball Analysis System is a comprehensive project that leverages machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning techniques to analyze basketball games. The system detects players, referees, and basketballs using YOLOv8, tracks their movements across frames, and assigns players to teams based on the colors of their t-shirts using KMeans clustering. Additionally, it implements optical flow to measure camera movement between frames, perspective transformation to represent the scene's depth and perspective, and calculates player speed and distance covered.

### Inside of the models folder are the custom object detection models I trained bu they are too large to upload to github
